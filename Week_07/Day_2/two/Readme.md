1. Copy the corrected dockerfile from the previous exercises to this folder and build a new docker image called "exercises_two".

2. Run `docker-compose up -d`. Why does it fail? Correct the error in the docker-compose file.

3. Once `docker-compose up -d` goes through check if the server is now running with a browser. Why is the app not running? Find out using docker logs. 
   There are two errors in the code of the project and the error logs will tell you where they are and how to correct them.
